This directory contains various code to test different combinations of
SSL implementations (e.g. OpenSSL, JSSE, Bouncy Castle) under various
configurations against each other.

Testing against OpenSSL requires that it be installed as the server is
provided by s_server.

The 'helloworld' file is meant to be read by the OpenSSL s_server in -WWW
mode because that's an easy way to get it to send messages to clients as
a response.

The PEM encoded key pair and Java KeyStore (used for both server & client
authentication), were created as follows:

# Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
<enter any passphrase>

# Strip passphrase
openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
<re-enter passphrase>

# Generate a self-signed certificate
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.crt -x509 -days 3600 -subj "/C=US/ST=IL/O=NCSA/OU=CSD/CN=Jon Siwek"

# Combine the key pair into a single file
cat server.crt server.key > server.pem

# Import the keys into a Java keystore, 'keystore.ImportKey'
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server.key -inform PEM -outform DER -out key.der
openssl x509 -in server.crt -inform PEM -outform DER -out cert.der

javac util/ImportKey.java
java -cp util/ ImportKey key.der cert.der
mv $HOME/keystore.ImportKey .

# Clean up temporary files
rm key.der cert.der util/ImportKey.class
