# bccvs
Contains BouncyCastle CVS repository of release 1.46.  Checked out like:

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.bouncycastle.org:/home/users/bouncy/cvsroot
cvs co -r r1rv46 java

If desired, it can be regularly updated (e.g. `cvs update`)
and the changes merged downstream into ssl3 and gss branches.

# ssl3
Contains changes to BouncyCastle's lightweight client TLS implementation
to allow it to speak SSLv3.  The main differences between SSLv3 and TLSv10
are listed below:

- the version number of TLS is 3.1 and SSL is 3.0
- slightly different MAC schemes (SSLv3 uses a draft HMAC implementation)
- different pseudorandom functions
- additional alert codes in TLS
- [skip] TLS does not support Fortezza while SSLv3 does
- SSLv3 has additional client certificate types for ephemeral Diffie Hellman
  schemes (and Fortezza) that TLS does not
- hashes calculated differently over the certificate verify handshake message
- different calculation of the master secret
- block cipher padding lengths. In SSLv3, the padding length is the
  minimum required to obtain a multiple of the cipher's block length
  while TLS allows any padding length that results in a multiple of
  the block length

# gss
Contains changes to the BouncyCastle's lightweight client TLS implementation
to allow it to be used in a GSSAPI implementation.

# master
Contains merged changes from the ssl3 and gss branches.

# debug
Includes extra debugging messages that get printed to stdout.
